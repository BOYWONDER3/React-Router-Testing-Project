###  The goal of this project is to practice testing a larger scale project with routing and API requests.

# Procedures
- Test that the filtering on the PostList page works as expected. This will require quite a bit or API mocking.
- Test that the NewPost page works when creating a post. This again will require lots of API mocking, and will even deal with navigating to new pages.
